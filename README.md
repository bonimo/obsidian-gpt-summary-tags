This is a plugin for Obsidian (https://obsidian.md).

This project uses Typescript to check for new notes added to the vault, reads them, summarses them and adds content tags using GPT4.
The repo depends on the latest plugin API (obsidian.d.ts) in Typescript Definition format, which contains TSDoc comments describing what it does.
